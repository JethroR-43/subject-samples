<h2>The New Testament Books</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ's birth, teaching, Passion, Death, and Resurrection are narrated and proclaimed in the New Testament, whereas the Old Testament
  covers God's various covenants with Israel, especially the Sinai covenant mediated by Moses. The New Testament Covers God's definitive
  covenant with all people mediated by His incarnate Son, Jesus Christ. God's commitment to all His people, which Jesus sealed with His own
  bloody sacrifice on the Cross, is the focus of the seconds part of the New Testament.</p>
<p>While the Old Testament books are classified into three categories, the twenty-seven books of the New Testament are grouped into
  four categories.</p>

<h3>The 4 Categories:</h3>
<p>1. <b>Gospels</b>. The Gospels consist of the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. They announce the Good News of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
  They were authored by writers known as evangelists, a term derived from the Greek word <mark title="announcement of the good news">evangelion</mark>
  . Among the books of the New Testament, the four Gospels are the principal witnesses to the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>2. <b>Acts of the Apostles</b>. This category describes the early evangelization of the Good News to the world and the formation of
  the early Church.</p>
<p>3. <b>Letters</b>. The twenty-one letters in the Bible are called epistles. Thirteen of these are attributed to St. Paul and are adressed
  to the members and leaders of the early Christian communities. They offer practical guidelines on how to live a Christian life. The letter to
  the Hebrews presents Jesus in the light of the Old Testament. The remaining letters express how Christians should apply Jesus' teachings
  in their daily lives.</p>
<p>4. <b>Revelation</b>. The book of Revelation, also called <mark title="a disclosure or revelation of knowledge.">Apocalypse</mark> is the only prophetic
  book in the New Testament. It is a highly symbolic and visionary account of the decisive struggle of Christ and His followers against Satan and
  his forces</p>
