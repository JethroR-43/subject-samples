<h2>Spotlight on Reading</h2>
<hr>
<p>Ben Johnson established himself as one of the towering figures of English literature. He made important contributions to stage comedy
and English poetry. As a poet, he is known for his graceful and clear expression, his command in the use of wit, and his display of classical Greek
and Latin learning.</p>
<p>As you read the poem below, see how he uses tangible things to clearly express or explain something ethereal - that which is not of the
earth. Study also how the poet uses words descriptive enough to form picturesin the reader's mind. Note how these images help build the theme of the
poem.</p>
