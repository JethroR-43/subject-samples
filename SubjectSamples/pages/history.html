<h1>History</h1>
<p>One of the most used government systems today is democracy. It allows people to actively participate in activities and make the right decisions
  for their own future! Many laws have been added and changed greatly over the years, but the concept of democracy is mostly unchanged.</p>

<p>The first known kind of democracy was invented in the <mark title="city-state">polis</mark> of Athens, Greece. Previously, the city was ruled by 
  <mark title='a Greek word meaning "ruler"'>archons</mark> and rich people. They followed an oral law until <b>Solon</b> made it so that the law
  was being regulated by a court.</p>
<p>During his reign, Solon also gave the free citizens of Attica the right to participate in assembly meetings. Through this, he reshaped the social
  framework of the government. This gave opportunities for people to voice out their opinions and allowed the court to see things from different
  perspectives. </p>
<p>Democracy temporarily reverted to tyranny under <b>Peisistratos</b>, but was returned after his son <b>Hippias</b> was
  <mark title="violently banished or exiled">expulsed.</mark> <b>Cleisthenes</b> united all people under one rule regardless of status or wealth.
  He made the traditional tribes politically irrelevant and established 10 new tribes instead.</p>
<p>The third set of reforms was instigated by <b>Ephialtes</b>. While many were assisting the Spartans in war, he reduced the power of the 
  <mark title="court in Ancient Greece">Aeropagus</mark> to judging crimes like cases of homicide instead.</p>
<p>Democratic regimes continued until Athens surrendered to <b>Sparta</b> and they were under the control of the so-called
  <mark title="a pro-Spartan oligarchy">Thirty Tyrants</mark>. After a year, they gradually shifted back to democracy until their downfall
  to the <b>Macedonians</b> led by <b>Phillip II</b> </p>
